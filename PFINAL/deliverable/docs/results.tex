\section{Various results}


In this section we will present a number of results regarding our problem. 

Yanakakis presents an algorithm that finds a min-cut linear arrangement of a tree in O(n log n) time \cite{yan}

The MINCUT problem for genera1 graphs is NP-complete
[11,13]. The restriction of the problem to trees has been open for some time.
Lengauer described an approximation algorithm in [16] that produces a layout
with cutwidth at most twice the optimal. He also determined exactly the cutwidth
of complete k-ary trees. F. R. K. Chung studied the properties of optimal layouts
[2]. M. Chung et al. present in [5] an algorithm that solves the MINCUT problem
on trees in time O(n(log n)d-2) where d is the maximum degree of the tree. Thus,
their algorithm works in polynomial time for bounded degree trees, but exponential
time in generxal. Dolev and Trickey [7] study the MINCUT problem on trees and
give an O(n log n) algorithm for a planar version of it, where no edge crossings are
allowed if the tree is drawn as in Figure 1 with all the edges above the line where
the nodes lie.


\textbf{TODO: explain well this part of Yanakakis' paper. Its uploaded in the repo}
\textbf{TODO: obviously, add the bibliography}
