\section{Various results}


In this section we will present a number of results regarding our problem. 


The problem for genera1 graphs is NP-complete \cite{Garey79}, \cite{Gavril77}, even for planar graphs \cite{MS85}
For fixed cost k, the problem can be solved in $O(n^{k-1})$ time \cite{Ma82}. For trees, better results have been found.

The restriction of the problem to trees has been open for some time.
In 1982 Lengauer described an approximation algorithm for trees in \cite{Len82}
that produces a layout with cutwidth at most twice the optimal. He also determined exactly the cutwidth of complete k-ary trees.  M. Chung et al. present in \cite{Chu82} an algorithm that solves the MINCUT problem
on trees in time $O(n(log n)^{d-2})$ where d is the maximum degree of the tree. Thus,
their algorithm works in polynomial time for bounded degree trees, but exponential
time in general. Yanakakis in 1983, presents an algorithm that finds a min-cut linear arrangement of a tree in O(n log n) time \cite{yan}.
