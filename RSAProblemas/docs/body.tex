\section*{Exercise 2}

We first compute $x=b^c mod \phi(p)$ \\
Then we compute  $a^x mod p$. 

Why is this correct? Simply because for every p,a, as Euler tells us that$a^{\phi(p)}=1 mod p$, we have the following $ a^k = a^{k+\phi(p)*l} mod p $.

This takes polynomial time, as modular exponentiation can be computed in polynomial time, with use of repeated squaring.
