\section{Parametrized Problems}

Using this problem, and combining it with a computable function $ \kappa : \Sigma^* \rightarrow N $ we can formulate a Parametrized version of this problem. 


An example:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | p{5cm} |}
    \hline
    Input & Graph G and tw = treewidth(G)\\ \hline
    Paremeters & tw  \\ \hline
    Question & What is the Min-Cut Linear Arrangement of G?\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Given that we find an expression Monadic Second Order Logic, the above can be solved in $O(n*f(tw))$ \cite{trans}. 


Obviously, one parametrization that makes our problem FPT, is the following:



\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | p{5cm} |}
    \hline
    Input & Graph G \\ \hline
    Paremeters & V(G)  \\ \hline
    Question & What is the Min-Cut Linear Arrangement of G?\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Here we can use our bruteforce algorithm on the possible linear arrangements of G, which runs in $V(G)!*(V(G)*E(G)$ time, 
where $V(G)!$ is to create every possible linear arrangement and $(V(G)*E(G)$ is to compute a cutwidth of a given arrangement.
So in this case we have $f(\kappa)*E(G)$ time.
