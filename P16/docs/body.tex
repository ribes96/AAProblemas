\section*{Problem statement}
\subsection*{The problem}

We have to prove that board games like chess or go in $nxn$ boards are in EXP.

\subsection*{The solution}

This is easy. We only have to give an exponential algorithm that solves such a 
game. 

The algorithm is as follows. We construct a tree of possible configurations
that can be produced from the initial configuration by moving pieces around. 
For every configuration in the board, there is exactly one node in this graph. 
It is a tree with back edges. While creating this tree, there some 
configurations in which either black or white wins. These are the leaves of 
the tree. 

The creation of this tree takes exponential time. (why?)

This tree will help us check if one of the two players has a winning strategy.

This concludes the proof.
